            <img src="product.jpg" alt="">
            <div>These personalized Christmas stockings are made of natural burlap, ivory quilted fabric and duck cloth! All fabrics are natural colors and ivory tones. They are perfect for the whole family and embroidered or monogrammed with your choice of name and font. These custom Christmas stockings are padded and hang beautifully even when empty! They are fully lined and made to last a lifetime. All handmade with a perfectionist's quality. There are 6 different options to choose from.  Made from my own pattern these Christmas stockings are the perfect size... not to big and not to small. They are slightly larger than most stockings you find in a retail store. The quality is far superior! If you would like a different thread color than what is pictured please specify what color you want at checkout! I can do any color.</div> */}
